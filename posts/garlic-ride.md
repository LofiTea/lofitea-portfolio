# GarlicRide

For my very first hackathon, I built a ridesharing website with three other people. GarlidRide was built on the idea that fast, convenient, and cheap ridesharing services should be available to everyone (only for Purdue-affiliated people, no IU people allowed!). It aimed to help people on the West Lafayette campus and beyond to make ridesharing very convenient.

## Tools

For this project, the following tools were utilized to develop the website:
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

This website was built with the following languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

GoogleMapsAPI was used as the framework to show a map on our website.  We also utilized Bootstrap as a framework to develop our website and to save time since we only had 24 hours to finish the project.

## My Role

For my end of the project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to develop the front end of the website.  I designed the website and put in the relevant content to show off our concept for the hackathon.  In total, there were seven web pages in the project (excluding any CSS or JavaScript utilized):
- about.html
- blog-home.html
- contact.html
- faq.html
- forum.html
- index.html
- map.html

## Features

There were two main features that our demo employed: the forum and the map.

1. Forum

   The idea of the forum was that a customer would drop off a request for a ride.  An available driver would be notified and they would go to the customer's location.  Once they get in, the driver will drive them to their destination.  It is a way to allow customers to communicate with the drivers on where they would like to go.

2. Map

    The idea of the map was to show a customer how far away a driver was near to them and to show an estimated time length of how their drive would be from their current location to their destination.
