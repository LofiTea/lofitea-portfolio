# Worlds Apart

In the beginning, there used to be one world. One place. A place where everyone and everything can coexist and thrive. There was peace and harmony. But everything changed when the Creator disappeared. Before anything could be done, everything fell apart. Everything changed for the worse. And there was no guidance or help to the seeds. The only way was to separate their realms into different worlds.

The Realms used to be worlds apart, coexisting in harmony. But just like everything made in the universe, nothing lasts forever. The World Tree nears the end of its lifespan, and time is running out. The Collide comes. And nothing can stop it.

But despite all odds, one must never give up hope. A small sliver of hope remains. We will not let the world we grew up in and lived in disappear. This is our home, our heaven and hell. We will not give up. Not like that. We will survive. We will stay alive. Because no matter what happens, our world is not yet lost...

## Origins

Worlds Apart is a passion project that I had created after years of ideas and brainstorming in my free time. Whenever I'm not busy programming or doing anything else, I like to come here and tell a story of the world that I created.

Everything started during the COVID-19 pandemic. When I couldn't go outside, I created different stories in my mind. Creating this world was difficult as I had many false starts and I often had to take long breaks because I didn't know how my story would progress. Additionally, with the pressure of doing well academically in high school so that I can go to college, I couldn't spend a lot of time on this project since school was more important.

However, I never gave up on this project. I had spent a lot of time developing the world and I didn't want it to go to waste. After getting out from the COVID slump, I was slowly forming ideas of how I can turn my writing project into something feasible. When I started my senior year of high school, I had some free time opened up in my schedule so I continued working on this project. Through hard work and grit, I was finally able to finish a 300-page draft of my story. I had did it. I was able to finish something that had took me years to finish.

## The Journey

Despite the finished draft, I was not satisfied.  There were still a lot of story holes that were still present and I knew that I could do a lot more with the story and the world I have built.  As a result, I started the process of expanding upon the first draft while also editing certain parts.  I cut back some content while also heavily revising certain others.

After two years of development in my free time, I had finally finished the short story collection. This project was the culimination of years of ideas and inspirations that I had gained as I went through my first year of college studying computer science. The finished product is over 700+ pages of content and 24 short stories.

## Timeline

- 2020: Started writing for this project. It was originally a story heavily inspired by Harry Potter and Genshin Impact, where the main character would go to a magical academy and discover their powers to eventually defeat an ancient evil that would consume the world.
- 2021: Took a pause during my junior year. My story did not have a clear structure and I didn't know what the direction of the story was going. Focused on schoolwork.
- 2022: Had some free time in my senior year since I had some space available in my schedule. Finished the first draft of my story during the first semester.
- 2023: Grduated from high school with academic honors. I started college and is currently studying computer science. Started the second version of my writing project during my free time.
- 2024: Finished my first year of college. Finished the second version in May 2024.
