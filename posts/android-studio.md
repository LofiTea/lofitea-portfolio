# Android Studio

When I do projects, I realize that I like to design things.  As a result, I looked at the idea of developing a simple mobile application.  Additionally, my strongest programming language is Java so I have looked at developing a mobile app with Android Studio. 

## Current Progress

Right now, I am looking at how the Android Studio software works and what the layout is like.  It is very similar to IntelliJ but there are some noticeable differences.  Therefore, I am lookng at making a simple calculator application after I finish a simple tutorial since I have familiarized myself with Java GUIs from a previous project.

## Future Plans

If possible, I would like to develop an application that helps people study.  This can include a Pomodore timer, a calendar, and a reminder.  It does not have to be made with Andriod Studio explicitly.
