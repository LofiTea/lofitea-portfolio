# Bejanaro Notes

In the spring semester of my sophomore year, I am currently taking CS 25100: Data Structure and Algorithms.  This is a very important class that I need to pass in order for me to be able to take upper-level computer science courses.  I have tried taking it in the fall semester but circumstances have made me unable to continue the class in that semester.

However, while I take the class in the fall semester, someone from my class has made a website that contains all of the lecture notes.  The website was built with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The link to the website <a href = "https://bejaranonotes.github.io/cs251/"> here</a> and the link to the repository is <a href = "https://github.com/BejaranoNotes/cs251"> here</a>.

## The Issue

When retaking the class, I noticed that someone posts pictures of the lecture notes on a forum.  It is usually a pinned discussion post where anyone can see them.  The issue with me is that there are over 30+ lectures in the semester and I don't want to see 30+ different pinned comments where it can be hard to find all of the lecture notes.

## What I Added

I did not change too much regarding the website.  The overall structure is the same.  The only minor changes I made was replacing last semester's lecture notes with this semester's lectures notes as well as adding a small download button that allows a student to get all of the images as a PDF.  I felt that this would have been a convenient feature since it would allow a student to have one file with all of the notes for a specific day.  Down below is a visual of what the changes look like:

I will continue to add the lecture notes for this class until the end of the semester.  In the meantime, the link to the customized lecture notes website is <a href = "https://lofitea.github.io/BejanaroNotes/"> here</a> and the link to the repository is <a href = "https://github.com/LofiTea/BejanaroNotes"> here</a>.
