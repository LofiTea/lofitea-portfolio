This is a story where gods have fallen and try to reclaim their glory.  This is a story where people discover their fates and try to find a way to go around them.  This is a story where trials are overcome.  This is a story where darkness consumes everything in its path, consumed by the potent evils dwelling in the shadows. \r\n\r\nThe Realms used to be worlds apart, coexisting in harmony.  But just like everything made in the universe, nothing lasts forever.  The World Tree nears the end of its lifespan, and time is running out.  The Collide comes.  And nothing can stop it.\r\n\r\nBut despite all odds, one must never give up hope.  A small sliver of hope remains.  We will not let the world we grew up in and lived in disappear.  Not like that.  We will survive.  Because no matter what happens, this world is not yet lost... \r\n\r\n## Origins\r\n\r\nWorlds Apart is a passion project that I had created after years of ideas and brainstorming in my free time.  Whenever I'm not busy programming or doing anything else, I like to come here and tell a story of the world that I created.  \r\n\r\nEverything started during the COVID-19 pandemic.  When I couldn't go outside, I created different stories in my mind.  Creating this world was difficult as I had many false starts and I often had to take long breaks because I didn't know how my story would progress.  Additionally, with the pressure of doing well academically in high school so that I can go to college, I couldn't spend a lot of time on this project since school was more important.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never gave up on this project.  I had spent a lot of time developing the world and I didn't want it to go to waste.  After getting out from the COVID slump, I was slowly forming ideas of how I can turn my writing project into something feasible.  When I started my senior year of high school, I had some free time opened up in my schedule so I continued working on this project.  Through hard work and grit, I was finally able to finish a 300-page draft of my story.  I had did it.  I was able to finish something that had took me years to finish\r\n\r\n## Project Edea\r\n\r\nAlthough I was able to finish a draft of my project, when I looked back on it, I realized that I could do a lot more with it.  There were some changes that I made to my world and I didn't like some of the things from my first draft.  As a result, I am currently working on a more expanded and updated version of my project.  It is going to be as twice as long and the first draft is planned to be completed by 2024.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- 2020: Started writing for this project.  It was originally a story heavily inspired by Harry Potter and Genshin Impact, where the main character would go to a magical academy and discover their powers to eventually defeat an ancient evil that would consume the world.  \r\n- 2021: Took a pause during my junior year.  My story did not have a clear structure and I didn't know what the direction of the story was going.  Focused on schoolwork.\r\n- 2022: Had some free time in my senior year since I had some space available in my schedule.  Finished the first draft of my story during the first semester.\r\n- 2023: Grduated from high school with academic honors.  I started college and is currently studying computer science.  Started the second version of my writing project during my free time.\r\n- 2024:  I expect to finish the expanded version by this year (not sure exactly when).  Finished my freshman year and will start my sophomore year.\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\nTo see the progress made in my project, check out the link <a href='https://www.wattpad.com/story/355628801-worlds-apart-the-edea-chronicles'>here</a>."},"__N_SSG":true}
